"As cancer treatments have shifted toward targeted therapies, the role of 
developmental signaling pathways in tumorigenesis has garnered special 
attention. For example, the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is required for cerebellar 
development, and its constitutive activation can lead to pediatric 
medulloblastomas. Hh signaling is normally initiated by the binding of Hh 
ligands (Shh, Ihh, and Dhh) to the 12TM Patched1 (Ptch1) receptor resulting in 
accumulation and activation of the G protein-coupled receptor-like protein 
Smoothened (Smo) within the primary cilium. How Smo regulates Gli transcription 
factor function remains unclear, but this process involve the scaffolding 
protein Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), which can directly inhibit the Gli proteins 
and facilitate their proteolytic processing into N-terminal repressors. Smo is 
perhaps the most “druggable” target within the Hh pathway, and Smo inhibitors 
have demonstrated efficacy in murine tumor models and human clinical trials. 
However, certain cancers can proliferate in response to Gli activation through 
noncanonical mechanisms and therefore are insensitive to Smo inhibitors. Tumors 
that initially respond to Smo antagonists can also acquire mutations in Smo or 
downstream pathway components that render them resistant to these 
chemotherapies. Chemical inhibitors that act downstream of Smo therefore 
constitute an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Hh 
pathway-dependent cancers. Most current approaches are biased overwhelmingly to 
find Smo antagonists or use non-physiological overexpressed Gli cell systems. We 
overcame these limitations by employing a cell-based reporter that lacks Sufu 
(Sufu-KO-LIGHT cells) and exhibits constitutive Hh target gene expression in 
response to endogenous Gli activators to interrogate the MLSMR. We report here 
for the first time on a novel potent (33.6 nM IC50), non-cytotoxic small 
molecule antagonist of Gli function that does not inhibit Wnt3a signaling."

"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common brain cancer diagnosed among children. 
The cellular pathways that regulate MB invasion in response to environmental 
cues remain incompletely understood. Herein, we examine the migratory response 
of human MB-derived Daoy cells to different concentration profiles of Epidermal 
Growth Factor (EGF) using a microfluidic system. Our findings provide the first 
quantitative evidence that EGF concentration gradients modulate the chemotaxis 
of MB-derived cells in a dose-dependent manner via the EGF receptor (EGF-R). 
Data illustrates that higher concentration gradients caused increased number of 
cells to migrate. In addition, our results show that EGF-induced receptor 
phosphorylation triggered the downstream activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase 
(PI3K)/Akt pathway, while its downstream activation was inhibited by Tarceva (an 
EGF-R inhibitor), and Wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor). The treatment with 
inhibitors also severely reduced the number of MB-derived cells that migrated 
towards increasing EGF concentration gradients. Our results provide evidence to 
bolster the development of anti-migratory therapies as viable strategies to 
impede EGF-stimulated MB dispersal."

"Medulloblastoma encompasses a group of aggressively growing cancers that arise 
either in the cerebellum or brain stem. They present primarily in children, with 
80-85 % of medulloblastomas being diagnosed in patients of 16 years and younger. 
In adults, medulloblastomas are rare and account for less than 1 % of 
intracranial malignancies. Due to the low incidence of medulloblastoma in 
adults, the biology and genetics of adult medulloblastomas have long been poorly 
understood. Many centers therefore still treat adults either by radiotherapy 
only or by using glioblastoma protocols (both often noncurative), or with 
standard pediatric medulloblastoma regimes (often associated with dose-limiting 
toxicity).Current clinical staging systems discriminate between standard-risk or 
high-risk patients based on clinical and histological parameters. However, 
clinico-pathological features often fail to accurately predict treatment 
response. In children, molecularly defined risk assessment has become important 
to improve survival of high-risk patients and to decrease treatment-related 
toxicity and long-term sequelae in standard-risk patients. However, several 
recent studies have shown that adult and pediatric medulloblastomas are 
genetically distinct and may require different algorithms for molecular risk 
stratification. Moreover, four subtypes of medulloblastoma have been identified 
that appear at different frequencies in children and adults and that have a 
different prognostic impact depending on age. Molecular markers such as 
chromosome 10q and chromosome 17 statuses can be used for molecular risk 
stratification of adult medulloblastoma, but only in a subgroup-specific 
context. Here we present an overview of the current knowledge of the genomics of 
adult medulloblastoma and how these tumors differ from their pediatric 
counterparts."

"X-linked adreno-leukodystrophy (ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder affecting the 
white matter of the central nervous system and the adrenal cortex. It is caused 
by mutations in the ABCD1 gene encoding for a peroxisomal membrane protein. The 
absent genotype-phenotype correlation implies a contribution by environmental 
factors to explain the phenotypical heterogeneity. We report on a 4-year-old boy 
with a biochemically confirmed diagnosis of ALD after birth. At the age of 32 
months, the additional diagnosis of a medulloblastoma was made. After treatment 
of the medulloblastoma, he developed active areas of demyelination representing 
the characteristic neuroimaging features of ALD. The clinical history of our 
patient supports the hypothesis that external factors, like neurosurgical 
intervention as part of medulloblastoma treatment, may accelerate or initiate 
cerebral ALD-related demyelination. A postsurgical inflammatory reaction may 
facilitate the inclusion of abnormal fatty acids in myelin. The opening of the 
blood-brain barrier following neurosurgery may enhance the recognition of 
previously sequestered antigens considered to play a role in ALD onset. 
Consequently, neurosurgical disruption of the BBB can precipitate the 
immune-mediated inflammatory process, which progressively destroys myelin in ALD 
patients. Tumor-related chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may also play a 
contributing role. We suggest that X-ALD patients who undergo neurosurgical 
intervention need close follow-up imaging to identify active demyelination 
early."

tumors is not clearly defined.
AIM: To report a Chilean experience with NSNE tumors evaluated using PET with 
FDG.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the database of a PET laboratory. 
Demographic data, indications and metabolic findings were compared with 
conventional imaging in 88 adults and children with diverse bone and soft tissue 
sarcomas as well as 24 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), 6 pleural 
malignant mesotheliomas in adults, and 9 medulloblastomas in children.
RESULTS: FDG showed good concordance with conventional imaging in NSNE tumors. 
It was helpful for staging, restaging, follow-up after treatment and for the 
detection of new not previously suspected lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: PET with FDG could have a prognostic role and help in patient 
management, mainly in musculoskeletal and high grade or less differentiated 
sarcomas. In GIST, it was a good tool for immunotherapy control."

population, medulloblastomas are rare in adults, with an incidence of 0.5 per

disease have been done in the pediatric population, and therefore therapy for 
adult medulloblastoma has been either extrapolated from the pediatric literature

"OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of β-catenin protein and the status of loss 
of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromsome 10q in medulloblastoma, with clinical 
correlation.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical study for β-catenin protein was carried out in 50 
cases of medulloblastoma encountered in the First Affiliated Hospital of 
Xinjiang Medical University during the period from 2002 to 2011, including 32 
cases of classic medulloblastoma, 13 cases of desmoplastic medulloblastoma and 5 
cases of medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity. The status of LOH on 10q was 
also detected by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. The clinicopathologic 
characteristics and prognostic parameters were studied by Kaplan-Meien and Cox 
analysis.
RESULTS: The rates of expression of β-catenin protein in classic 
medulloblastoma, desmoplastic medulloblastoma and medulloblastoma with extensive 
nodularity were 53.1% (17/32), 4/13 and 1/5, respectively. The rate of LOH on 
10q was 33.3% (8/24) in classic medulloblastoma and 2/11 in desmoplastic 
medulloblastoma. There was no statistically significant difference between the 
two tumor types. Univariate analysis showed that the expression of β-catenin 
protein (P = 0.022), lack of LOH on 10q (P = 0.020), extensiveness of tumor 
resection (P < 0.01), radiotherapy (P = 0.002) and chemotherapy (P < 0.01) 
represented important prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Medulloblastoma with expression of β-catenin protein and without 
LOH on 10q carries a better prognosis. Assessment of these parameters is helpful 
in evaluating prognosis and subsequent patient management."

"The unambiguous demarcation of tumor margins is critical at the final stages in 
the surgical treatment of brain tumors because patient outcomes have been shown 
to correlate with the extent of resection. Real-time high-resolution imaging 
with the aid of a tumor-targeting fluorescent contrast agent has the potential 
to enable intraoperative differentiation of tumor versus normal tissues with 
accuracy approaching the current gold standard of histopathology. In this study, 
a monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
1 (VEGFR-1) was conjugated to fluorophores and evaluated as a tumor contrast 
agent in a transgenic mouse model of medulloblastoma. The probe was administered 
topically, and its efficacy as an imaging agent was evaluated in vitro using 
flow cytometry, as well as ex vivo on fixed and fresh tissues through 
immunohistochemistry and dual-axis confocal microscopy, respectively. Results 
show a preferential binding to tumor versus normal tissue, suggesting that a 
topically applied VEGFR-1 probe can potentially be used with real-time 
intraoperative optical sectioning microscopy to guide brain tumor resections."

"The relationship between inflammation, immunity and cancer is widely accepted 
but mechanisms mediating this relationship remain unknown. Our present study was 
undertaken to examine the presence and distribution of Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs) in necrotic areas of medulloblastoma. These receptors fulfil the criteria 
postulated for the receptors of innate immunity and signalling from TLRs induces 
synthesis of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes and mediators. The 
study was performed on human medulloblastoma samples containing areas of 
necrosis within the tumour and/or within the normal nerve tissue at the 
periphery of the tumour. Proteins of four TLRs: TLR 2, 3, 4 and 9 were detected 
in the tissue with the immunohistochemical method using the specific antibodies. 
Two types of necrotic areas were found. In the first type, the area of dead 
cells was surrounded by undifferentiated medulloblastoma cells. A lot of these 
cells expressed TLR 2 and TLR 3 antigens. TLR 2 was also expressed on the wall 
of de novo formed blood vessels that fill tumour regions already cleared from 
dead cells. The second type of necrotic areas were found at the periphery of the 
tumour and composed of normal nerve tissue cells. TLR 2, TLR 3 and TLR 9 were 
detected in hypertrophic glia cells. Our findings show a new function of TLRs as 
sensors of pathogens released by medulloblastoma dead cells. This new function 
may provide a key link connecting innate immunity, neuroinflammation and 
angiogenesis in the tumour."

"PURPOSE: Associations of radiation therapy (RT) deviations and outcomes in 
medulloblastoma have not been defined well, particularly in the era of 
reduced-dose craniospinal irradiation and chemotherapy. The aim of this study is 
to evaluate the quality of RT on Children's Cancer Group/Pediatric Oncology 
Group 9961 and analyze associations of RT deviations with outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Major volume deviations were assessed based on the 
distance from specified anatomical region to field edge. We investigated 
associations of RT deviations with progression-free survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS), and explored associations with demographics and clinical 
variables.
RESULTS: Of the 308 patients who were evaluable for volume deviations, 101 
patients (33%) did not have any. Of the remaining 207 patients, 50% had only 
minor deviations, 29% had only major deviations, and 21% had both minor and 
major deviations. Of the patients with major deviations, 73% had a single major 
deviation. The most common major deviation was in the cribriform plate region, 
followed by the posterior fossa (PF); PF deviations resulted from treating less 
than whole PF. There were no significant differences in PFS or OS between 
patients with deviations and those without. There was no evidence of 
associations of deviations with patient age.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of patients had major volume deviations. 
There was no evidence of a significant association between these and outcome. 
This lack of correlation likely reflects the current high quality of RT 
delivered in Children's Oncology Group institutions, our strict definition of 
volume deviations, and the relatively few instances of multiple major deviations 
in individual patients. In is noteworthy that the types of PF volume deviations 
observed in this study were not adversely associated with outcome. As we move 
forward, quality assurance will continue to play an important role to ensure 
that deviations on study do not influence study outcome."

"A method for automatic analysis and interpretation of histopathology images is 
presented. The method uses a representation of the image data set based on bag 
of features histograms built from visual dictionary of Haar-based patches and a 
novel visual latent semantic strategy for characterizing the visual content of a 
set of images. One important contribution of the method is the provision of an 
interpretability layer, which is able to explain a particular classification by 
visually mapping the most important visual patterns associated with such 
classification. The method was evaluated on a challenging problem involving 
automated discrimination of medulloblastoma tumors based on image derived 
attributes from whole slide images as anaplastic or non-anaplastic. The data set 
comprised 10 labeled histopathological patient studies, 5 for anaplastic and 5 
for non-anaplastic, where 750 square images cropped randomly from cancerous 
region from whole slide per study. The experimental results show that the new 
method is competitive in terms of classification accuracy achieving 0.87 in

"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a common problem in pediatric patients with cancer. 
Reported prevalence varies widely and has often been assessed only in a subset 
of childhood types of cancer. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of 
malnutrition among pediatric patients newly diagnosed with cancer, to describe 
the occurrence and course of malnutrition during therapy and to identify factors 
associated with malnutrition during therapy.
PROCEDURE: In a retrospective cohort study of 327 patients diagnosed from 2003 
to 2006 in three Swiss tertiary care hospitals, weight and height measures 
together with patient-, disease-, and treatment-related characteristics were 
assessed. Malnutrition was defined as body mass index (BMI) below -2 standard 
deviation scores (SDS) or a weight loss >10% from diagnosis. Malnutrition was 
assessed at diagnosis and continuously during anticancer therapy.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, 5.8% of the patients (19) were malnourished based on BMI. 
During anticancer therapy, the cumulative incidence of malnutrition rose to 22% 
(70 patients) after 30 days, to 36% (116 patients) after 60 days, and finally to 
47% (155 patients). In these 155 patients, the median duration of malnutrition 
was 60 days (interquartile range, 21-122). Age above 10 years at diagnosis, BMI 
≤ -1.0 SDS at diagnosis, and a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were positively 
associated with a higher proportion of malnutrition time during therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The rapid increase of malnutrition after the start of treatment 
underlines the need to develop evidence-based and efficient methods to provide 
nutritional support for children with cancer."

"OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to confirm the hypothesis that pre-operative 
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can be used to distinguish between ""low 
grade"" and ""high grade"" tumours in paediatric patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: ADC values were retrospectively evaluated in thirty-six 
paediatric brain tumours. Twenty-one children with low grade brain tumours (12 
WHO I astrocytomas, 1 giant cell tumour, 1 pilomyxoid astrocytoma, 4 WHO II 
astrocytomas, 2 craniopharyngiomas and 1 ganglioglioma) and 15 children with 
high grade brain tumours (6 medulloblastomas, 3 WHO III ependymomas, 1 PNET, 1 
malignant rhabdoid tumour, 1 malignant germ cell tumour, 1 WHO III astrocytoma, 
1 WHO IV astrocytoma, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma metastasis) were included in this 
study. Minimum and mean ADC values were compared between low grade and high 
grade tumours and cut-off values were evaluated.
RESULTS: The cut-off values to differentiate low and high grade paediatric brain 
tumours were 0.7 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 1.0 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s for minimum ADC and 
average ADC values respectively. All but one high grade infratentorial 
ependymoma showed significantly lower ADC values than low grade brain tumours in 
children.
CONCLUSION: Combining the information obtained from conventional MR imaging with 
the ADC values may increase the accuracy of pre-operative differentiation 
between low grade and high grade paediatric tumours. Cut-off values can help to 
discern low from high grade tumours. However, it has to be considered that there 
is a substantial overlap between tumour types previously described in the 
literature."
